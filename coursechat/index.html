I was the main developer of Emory CourseChat, a virtual TA platform for courses at Emory. This was part of my contribution to the Dean's task force on artificial intelligence at Goizueta. Below is a video demonstrating what it can do in my course Investments (FIN323). If you are an Emory faculty member you can <a href="http://coursechat.emory.edu">try it out yourself!</a>
